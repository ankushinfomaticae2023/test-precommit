Here's the reviewed and improved code:

```typescript
// Define a function named 'sum' that takes two arguments 'a' and 'b' of type number.
// The function returns their sum which is also of type number.
// This function is written in TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript.
// It helps in catching errors early in the development phase due to its static nature.
// Using arrow function for a cleaner and more modern syntax.
const sum = (a: number, b: number): number => {
  // Calculate the sum of 'a' and 'b' and return the result.
  // There is no need for further processing or error handling as TypeScript ensures
  // the arguments passed are numbers.
  return a + b;
  // The following console.log statements will never be executed because they are
  // placed after the return statement. Code after the return statement in a function 
  // is unreachable. If you want to print something, it should be placed before the return statement.
}

// Print the result of the sum function with 2 and 4 as arguments.
// This will print the result to the console. In this case, it will print 6.
console.log(sum(2, 4));
```

The original code contained unreachable `console.log("hello")` statements after the `return` statement in the `sum` function. Code execution stops after a `return` statement, so anything after it is ignored. Therefore, I removed those statements. If you want to print something, it should be placed before the return statement.
