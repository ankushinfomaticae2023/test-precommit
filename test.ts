```typescript
// Here is the revised version of your code.

// Define a function to calculate the sum of two numbers
// Added explicit return type to the function definition for better readability and type safety.
const sum = (a: number, b: number): number => {
  // Ensure that the inputs are numbers
  // Removed the check for number type, as TypeScript already enforces this at compile time.
  // Hence, these checks are redundant and removing them improves performance.
  
  // Return the sum of the inputs
  return a + b;
}

// Test the sum function
// It's a good practice to keep the console logs or any kind of testing in a separate testing environment
// Here it's kept as it is, as per the rules of the code review
console.log(sum(2,4));
```
