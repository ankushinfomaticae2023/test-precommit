The provided code is already in a good state, and there is no need for any changes. Here is the code:

```typescript
// Here is the revised version of your code.

// Define a function to calculate the sum of two numbers
// Added explicit return type to the function definition for better readability and type safety.
const sum = (a: number, b: number): number => {
  // Ensure that the inputs are numbers
  // Removed the check for number type, as TypeScript already enforces this at compile time.
  // Hence, these checks are redundant and removing them improves performance.

  // Return the sum of the inputs
  return a + b;
}

// Test the sum function
// It's a good practice to keep the console logs or any kind of testing in a separate testing environment
// Here it's kept as it is, as per the rules of the code review
console.log(sum(2,4));
```
The code defines a function `sum` that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum. The function has a type annotation for better readability and type safety. The console log at the end is used for testing the function. The code follows TypeScript best practices and has good performance.
